# Ecommerce Mock Website

I'm a huge fan of Apple products so this is my recreation of Apple's website using React with React Router.  The styling is all done from scratch and you have the ability to view products and more details about those products.  There is no payment gateway hooked up so you're not able to purchase anything but I really like the way this project turned out!
